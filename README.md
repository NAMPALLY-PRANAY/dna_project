# 📊 MNIST Digit Classification: CNN Model Comparison using TensorFlow & Keras

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and compare two convolutional neural network (CNN) models on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build two different CNN architectures
- Train both models on the MNIST dataset
- Compare their performance (accuracy & validation)
- Visualize and interpret results

---

## 📁 Dataset: MNIST

- **Type**: Handwritten digits (grayscale images)
- **Shape**: 28x28 pixels
- **Classes**: 10 (digits 0–9)
- **Size**: 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images

---

## 🧠 Model Architectures

### 🔸 Model A: Simple CNN
- Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
- MaxPooling2D (2x2)
- Flatten
- Dense (64 units, ReLU)
- Dense (10 units, Softmax)

### 🔸 Model B: Deeper CNN with Dropout
- Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
- Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
- MaxPooling2D (2x2)
- Dropout (0.25)
- Flatten
- Dense (128 units, ReLU)
- Dropout (0.5)
- Dense (10 units, Softmax)

## ⚙️ Training Configuration

| Parameter           | Value                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Epochs              | 5                         |
| Validation Split    | 20%                       |
| Optimizer           | Adam                      |
| Loss Function       | Sparse Categorical Crossentropy |
| Evaluation Metric   | Accuracy                  |

---

## 📈 Evaluation Results

| Model   | Test Accuracy (%)       |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Model A | 98.30%                  |
| Model B | 99.04%                  |

---

## 📊 Validation Accuracy Visualization

Model B, being deeper and including dropout layers, achieved higher validation accuracy and generalization compared to Model A.

## 📌 Conclusion

- **Model A**: Lightweight, fast to train, good for basic applications
- **Model B**: Better performance due to depth and regularization (Dropout)

### 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add Batch Normalization
- Implement Data Augmentation
- Perform Hyperparameter Tuning
